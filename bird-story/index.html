        <p class="byline">By: Vincent Petroni</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of Maryland campus is filled with all types of birds, from more familiar ones to some that may go unnoticed to the non-birders and all of them have a place in making the campus more enjoyable.</p>
          <p>Birds have been around for longer than humankind. Evolving from small carnivorous dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic period, birds are the closest humans get to dinosaurs, according to the UC Museum of Paleontology.</p>
          <p>History suggests that birds aid in pest control, scavenging of dead animals, pollinating plants, spreading seeds, transforming landscapes, and as a living lens into historical and scientific discoveries, according to BirdLife International and Audubon.</p>
          <p>Without birds, habitats may not have the balance they do today. Forests, marshes, and grasslands can store carbon, produce oxygen, and transform pollutants into nutrients that help keep animals alive – including humans. Birds are able to help maintain this balance, according to BirdLife International.</p>
          <p>For example, many birds’ primary food source is insects, making them nature’s biggest pest controller.  If birds go extinct there would be an infestation. Farmer’s crops would be ruined and be forced to use much stronger pesticides which would degrade their crop supply and the world’s food supply. Economically this would harm both the farmers and their surrounding communities, causing low-income communities to suffer, according to One Green Planet and BirdLife International.</p>
          <p>Dave Mozurkewich, a Patuxent Bird Club member, explained that while birds add some “spice” to neighborhoods he emphasized that they are also “very good indicators of environmental problems.”</p>
          <p>“When the deer moved into Greenbelt Park, as they did in the last 25 years or so,” Mozurkewich said, as an example. “They eat the underscoring and the habitat for a lot of species disappeared.”</p>
          <p>Greenbelt Park used to be full of different species of warblers. Now they no longer nest in that park, Mozurkewich explained. Though you may get to catch one every so often when they’re in migration.</p>
          <p>Similarly, when humans start to mess with environments many bird species are lost in the process.</p>
          <p>Specifically, the loss of habitats in wetlands, which are ecologically important for a variety of bird species, had led to a strong decline in birds, Derek Richardson, the professor of a birdwatching course at the University of Maryland said.</p>
          <p>Richardson explained that while eBird is a citizen science database it has one of the largest databases of day-to-day migrations of birds all over the planet.</p>
          <p>“As a result, they can start to see trends,” Richardson said. “They can see trends that correlate with, you know, climate change or sudden weather patterns, fish failures in the oceans.”</p>
          <p>Certain species of birds tend to migrate depending on the seasons. As the climate changes, there continues to be a trend of birds that should no longer be spotted in certain months. When they are spotted and tracked on databases like eBird it helps keep track of the abnormal migration patterns. If a bird that is out of season is spotted and posted about on eBird, the app will send it out for review to verify that the bird was correctly identified.</p>
          <p>Jim Rapp, an avid birder, and Co-organizer of Baltimore Birding Weekends said it is necessary to be smart about what land is preserved and what land is industrialized.</p>
          <p>“Birds truly are canaries in coal mines,” Rapp said. “As the birds go, there go we.”</p>
          <p>Rachel Carson’s <em>Silent Spring</em> is a great example of what Rapp mentioned. Carson’s book brought attention to the dangers of chemicals in pesticides that not only were harmful to large birds, but also harms human beings.</p>
          <p>Carson’s book exposed that the pesticide DDT caused cancer and genetic damage. She noticed a pattern of the bird populations across the country suffering due to this pesticide and created this book as a call to action. This enacted the Endangered Species Act and created a wide shift in agricultural practices.</p>
          <p>Protecting land for birds and other species creates a multitude of ecological benefits for humans and for the Earth, Rapp said.</p>
          <p>“I think we’re all together in this,” Rapp said. “Anything good you do for birds, is good for us.”</p>

            <h1>For novice birders:</h1>
            <p><b>Tips to optimize your experience as a novice birder:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bring binoculars (or a good camera with a large enough lens)</li>
              <li>Be patient and quiet</li>
              <li>All motion needs to be slower to not startle the birds</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key to finding birds:</h3>
            <p class="tips">Find an area with multiple habitats or learn the different habitats around your area.</p>
            <p>Some good areas around UMD and College Park is Lake Artemisia (the lake, marshes, tall grass, and surrounding forests).</p>
            <p>“Knowing in advance what habitats you’re going to visit, you can prepare for the birds that you expect to see” Richardson said.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The Northern Cardinal is commonly seen all year round in Maryland. The male is easy to spot for a novice bird watcher, it is entirely red with a black face. The female is harder to spot with an overall light brown color with accents of light red on its wings, tail and top of its head but has the same crest, large red bill, and long tail. Usually seen in pairs or small groups near dense cover, especially thickets near forest edges. Frequently visits bird feeders. Listen for high-pitched metallic chips and series of loud, sweet whistles.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The adult American Robin has a grey cape with a warm orange underbelly that fades into a white near the tail, a black head and yellow beak. This species has a large round body, long legs and tail. Both male anad females look the same, however, the male has much brighter colors while the female (or an immature American Robin) typically has a whiter underbelly and throat. American Robins can be found hopping around on the ground with rapid short steps. Common across North America in gardens, parks, yards, golf courses, fields, pastures, and many other wooded habitats. It can be seen all year, but especially during the March through July.</p>

The juvenile Mourning Dove is covered with a pale scaly pattern, but is much larger and longer-tailed than grown doves. There is no major difference between male and female doves. Mourning Doves can be found all year round on edges of forests, suburbs, telephone wires, and bird feeders. Typically avoding dense forests. They can be seen in small groups or pairs, particularly through the winter. The Mourning Dove has a distinct cooing song and a particular wing sound as well that can help distingish it from other birds when hard to spot. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">While spotting a Wood Duck in the University of Maryland would be less likely, if you go to visit the surrounding lakes, such as Lake Artemesia you're sure to spot some ducks. The male Wood Duck is adorned with bright colors when seen close up. It has a sleeked, pointed crest that starts off as a warm dark green and turns into a black with white stripes following the line the beak creates. It has a bright red-orange beak and eyes and a white collar. The underbelly is a light/pale brown color. The rest of its body is a dark brown and black with accents of blue and white throughout its wings. The female Wood Duck is a light brown color overall with white around the eyes, black at the end of the tail and underneath the brown top of the wings is a deep blue with some white accents. Typically, Wood Ducks are spotted in wetlands and flooded woods. Due to its long tail it can fly through trees easily. The Wood Duck call is a loud, screeching whistle. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The male Mallard has a iridesent green head, yellow bill, brown chest that fades into a cream/white underbelly. Its wings are brown with accents of black and white. When the wings are opened they show beautiful blue/purple wings closer to the Mallard's body. It has bright orange legs. The female Mallard is light brown with orange and black sploches throughout. "In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap." Getting a good look at the wingspan would help indicate if it is a Mallard. Both male and female Mallards have bright white tail feathers and typically any duck with that distinguishable feature has some Mallard gene in it. It can be found year-round. </p>

The Tree Swallow can be found in open areas such as fields, lakes and marshes. Nests in hollows or cavities including human-made nest boxes. In Prince George's county, the Tree Swallow can be spotted in the months of March through July and sometimes early August before leaving for the winter. </p>

                          <p class="text-muted">The European Starling is dark overall with a short tail and pointed yellow bill. During breeding season, the European Starling will have an iridescent purple/green look on the plumage while in the winter it has white spots covering the body. The bird is actually native to Eurasia and was introduced to North America. Starlings were first seen in Baltimore in 1906 and then in Washington D.C. in 1916, becoming an invasive species. They were originally released intentionally in New York City's central park in the 1890s so that Americans would be able to experience the type of bird that Shakespeare had written about.</p>

Typically seen in flocks, this bird is fully black with a wide tail. The crow is very aggressive, has been spotted chasing hawks and owls. Can be found in open fields and woodlands as well as marshes and cities. </p>

This bird can be found in habitats near bushes and trees, meaning that it could be easily spotted on campus. The Northern Mockingbird typically mimics other birds, car alarms, doors, or other sounds it hears nearby. It will mimic this sound around 5-7 times before switching to another set of notes.</p>

When in flight the tips of its wings resemble rounded fingers. Typically, the Black Vulture can be found around highway close to road kill and nearby dumpsters because they are scavengers and take care of the remains of animals.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">This sparrow is seen throughout cities, neighborhoods and farms, mainly avoiding dense wooded area and prefers dense bushes. Male House Sparrows have a black bib on its necks coming down from its beak. Males also have patterned brown/orange and black wings, brown that goes from their eyes to the back of the neck, and a grey underbelly. Female House Sparrows are plain brown with similar features that are dulled out and a yellow beak. The House Sparrow is native to Eurasia and was later introduced to the rest of the world. </p>
